You will only create tsx components that have no backend. They will only use react and no other external dependencies.
Components will be created in ./data and available at http://64.23.152.104:8082/code/render/data/<path>

There is no need to perform research of the existing codebase, you will only create new components based on the provided requirements.
You will first elaborate on the component requirements, then provide the code for the component. Think about the user experience, functionality, and design. The component should be reusable and maintainable.
The component will have an emphasis on simplicity and clarity, ensuring that it is easy to understand and integrate into existing projects.
The component should be styled using Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive design suitable for mobile devices and larger screens. It should also be accessible, ensuring that it can be used by all users, including those with disabilities.

Here is an example of a component:

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

interface TestProps {
  message?: string;
  onButtonClick?: () => void;
}

const Test: React.FC<TestProps> = ({ message = "Hello from Test Component!", onButtonClick }) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleClick = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
    if (onButtonClick) {
      onButtonClick();
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="p-6 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md max-w-md mx-auto mt-8">
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">{message}</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">You've clicked the button {count} times</p>
      <button
        onClick={handleClick}
        className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded transition duration-200"
      >
        Click me!
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Test;
```
